## Summary

> Summarize your implementation, including the most challenging aspects; remember to update the `report` section of the `package.json` file with the total number of hours it took you to complete M0 (`hours`), the total number of JavaScript lines you added, including tests (`jsloc`), the total number of shell lines you added, including for deployment and testing (`sloc`).


My implementation consists of `<how-many?>` components addressing T1--8. The most challenging aspect was `<challenging>` because `<explain-why>`.


## Correctness & Performance Characterization


> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation.


To characterize correctness, we developed `<number of tests>` that test the following cases: <summarize>.


*Performance*: The throughput of various subsystems is described in the `"throughput"` portion of package.json. The characteristics of my development machines are summarized in the `"dev"` portion of package.json.


## Wild Guess

> How many lines of code do you think it will take to build the fully distributed, scalable version of your search engine? Add that number to the `"dloc"` portion of package.json, and justify your answer below.
